# Advent of Code 2017

Official website: https://adventofcode.com/

### Language pool this year

 - Go
 - Ruby
 - PHP
 - JavaScript
 - Python
 
Why? Because that was the decision we made with my [AoC-buddy](https://github.com/Skarlso).

We will use this tool to get a random language every day (from the our defined pool):
